# react-navigation-addon-search-layout

A plain but perfectly acceptable search layout screen that looks good on iOS and Android.

## Installation

```
npm install react-navigation-addon-search-layout
```

This requires that you have `react-native-vector-icons` installed in your project, it uses the `Ionicons` font family. If you use the Expo managed workflow, it will work out of the box as that comes preinstalled and is available through `@expo/vector-icons`'.

## Usage

See [example/App.tsx](https://github.com/react-navigation/search-layout/blob/master/example/App.tsx).
